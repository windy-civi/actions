# Incremental Processing Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the incremental processing system implementation.

## Files

### `implementation_plan.md`

Comprehensive implementation plan for the incremental processing system, including:

- Problem statement and current issues
- Proposed hybrid approach (two-level timestamp tracking)
- Detailed metadata structure
- Implementation phases (1-6)
- Code examples and key functions

### `processing_flow.md`

Visual flow chart and detailed explanation of:

- Current bill processing pipeline
- Identified issues with repository-level timestamps
- New hybrid processing flow
- Text extraction integration
- Implementation strategy

## Overview

The incremental processing system solves the problem of missing new data and unnecessary reprocessing by implementing:

1. **Bill-level timestamps** (`logs_latest_update`, `extraction_latest_update`) - Fast filtering
2. **Action-level timestamps** (`log_file_created`, `text_extracted`) - Granular processing

This two-level approach provides both efficiency (skip most unchanged bills) and accuracy (never miss new actions).

## Branch

These changes are being developed on the `incremental-processing` branch.

## Status

ðŸ“‹ Planning complete, ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
