"""
Post-processor to clean up placeholder.json files after processing.

When a vote_event or event comes through before its bill, we create a placeholder.json
to hold the folder structure. Once the bill is processed (metadata.json exists), we can
safely delete the placeholder.

This module also reports "orphaned" placeholders - bills that never got real data,
with persistent tracking to show how long they've been orphaned.
